## My Favourite Open Source Projects

- **Meta Glasses GPT Vision API** - https://github.com/dcrebbin/meta-vision-api

    Very hacky implementation to allow the meta smart glasses to integrate with GPT Vision. The example allows you to automatically log food. Went *semi semi* viral on hacker news 

    **Demo:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiEDrcLCmew

 - **AI Interview Trainer**

    *Frontend:* https://github.com/dcrebbin/ai-interview-trainer-frontend
    
    *Backend:* https://github.com/dcrebbin/ai-interview-trainer-backend

    Full stack platform that allows a user to have a technical or non technical interview with an AI interviewer that's trained on the prospective company's hiring process
